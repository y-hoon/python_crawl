  "contents": "Keeping employees connected and working productively has become the glue holding many businesses together during the COVID-19 pandemic. And with social distancing ruling out face-to-face meetings anytime soon, the need for new digital tools to help teams collaborate better has soared.In addition to mainstays like Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zoom and Google Meet, there are range of start-ups and scale-ups working on innovative ways to connect workers. Increasingly, collaboration isn’t just about team chat: people work together in countless ways — meaning the tools they now need will likely come in many shapes and sizes.The rush to work from home, and more recently, to figure out how to safely re-open offices, has spurred companies to move quickly. There are a range of communication apps from which to choose: apps for instant messaging, video and email, work management tools to coordinate projects for teams, and collaborative productivity apps more tuned to teamwork than shuffling papers.“Many of the new startup tools are taking existing concepts and reinventing them,” said Angela Ashenden, principal analyst for workplace transformation at CCS Insight. In many cases that’s meant an end to assumptions about the need for on-premise, client-server applications — allowing companies to “[rethink] them for a millennial-rich cloud and mobile world where the focus is more on enabling real-time collaborative work, not cataloguing and sharing personal work,” she said.“…The current shift to remote work means that many teams and businesses are overhauling their thinking about how they work together, so it's a time of great opportunity for these new tools,” said Ashenden."

  "contents": "Personal computer shipments continued their brisk-as-all-get-out pace in the first quarter, with year-over-year increases from 32% to 52%, a pair of research firms said last week.Analysts disagreed over whether these increases were tied to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting work-at-home orders, the latter responsible for driving buying sprees globally in 2020. Instead, analysts credited carry-overs from last year for the robust numbers early this year, saying that the disruption of supply chains 12 months ago sustained a year-long domino effect.\"Unfulfilled demand from the past year has carried forward into the first quarter, and additional demand brought on by the pandemic has also continued to drive volume,\" said Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's mobile device trackers team, splitting the difference in assigning responsibility for the shipment numbers.\"There is no question when entering 2021 the backlog for PCs was extensive across business, consumer and education,\" added Ryan Reith, IDC program vice president, also in a statement.IDC estimated the year-over-year shipment increase for the March quarter at 52%, with Apple's gain of 112% the greatest by far of the top five personal computer manufacturers.Gartner Research agreed that this year's first-quarter increase was at least partly due to the poor numbers of the same period of 2020. \"Without the shipment chaos in early 2020, this quarter’s growth may have been lower,\" explained Mikako Kitagawa, a Gartner research director, in a separate statement. The comparison with what Gartner called \"a pandemic-constrained market\" of last year meant that this year's March quarter looked unusually good — at 32%, it was the fastest-growing quarter since the firm began tracking PC shipments at the turn of the century, Kitagawa said.Analysts chalked up the boost in PC shipments during 2020 to work-at-home mandates and to remote schooling initiatives instituted by public and private schools as well as by colleges and universities throughout the developed world. Families which had relied on a single shared personal computer prior to the pandemic, even those where every member had their own smartphone, discovered that they needed more machines, one per child for schooling, others for the adults to work remotely.The shipment number upswell through the March quarter may soon end, the analysts added, because of component shortages, notably in silicon. \"Semiconductor shortages are now adversely affecting the supply chain once again, with shipment lead times for some PCs extending to as long as four months,\" wrote Kitagawa of Gartner.Meanwhile, IDC noted that a combination of parts shortages and global shipping issues has triggered an increase in the average selling price, or ASP, of personal computers.Others have pointed out the resurgence in consumer PC shipments. In its earnings call for the December 2020 quarter, Microsoft said revenue from its \"non-Pro\" segment of Windows — which represented sales of Windows 10 Home to computer makers — was up 24% year over year.Of the top five computer makers — Lenovo, HP, Dell, Apple, and Acer — Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple was the winner in the increase sweepstakes for the March quarter, IDC and Gartner both asserted. Gartner said Apple increased shipments by nearly 49% while IDC estimated Apple's rise was, at 112%, more than double that."

  "contents": "Providing secure access to vital applications has been a key challenge for businesses forced to adapt to remote working during the pandemic. And with many businesses set to continue to support a distributed workforce even after offices reopen, it will remain a priority for IT for some time.With this in mind, VMware has unveiled a suite of security and endpoint management tools to support remote workers. , announced on Tuesday, combines VMware’s Workspace One, a “digital workspace platform” that delivers applications across a range of devices, with its Carbon Black Cloud endpoint security tools and SASE, which provides secure network access for distributed teams.“By combining these three things we can deliver value to the stakeholders that include employees, the CIO, CISO, lines of business and HR,” said Shankar Iyer, SVP and general manager, end user computing at VMware. “This results in highly engaged employees, a broader and more effective security model, reduced cost and overhead.”The tools will provide a “great user experience and consistent performance on any device, from any location, over any network,” said Renu Upadhyay, vice president for product and technical marketing, end user computing at VMware.VMware said that Anywhere Workspace meets customer demand for an integrated product offering. An integration between Workspace One and Carbon Black Cloud will bring “physical and virtual endpoint management and security capabilities” together, for instance, while Workspace One and SASE will enable zero trust network access over globally deployed points of presence. More integrations are planned going forward.The move to remote work exposed weaknesses in IT operations and business infrastructures, especially around how end-user workspaces or working environments are handled, said Phil Hochmuth, IDC program vice president covering enterprise mobility. VMware’s Anywhere Workspace tools can help here, he said.“Getting devices delivered, set up, configured, and secure to spec has been a huge challenge for organizations where all the tools they used for this were based on the premise that the device would be inside the corporate perimeter (on-prem firewalls/corporate LANS, or remote VPN/WAN setups),” he said.The launch of the Anywhere Workspace suite is “very timely,” said Bob Laliberte, practice director and senior analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group. As organizations embrace work-from-home and hybrid work strategies, IT teams are required to deliver “secure, personalized experiences that also ensure workers are productive, regardless of where they are working,” he said. With this in mind, a packaged suite of apps “should be attractive to customers, enabling a comprehensive solution to power a secure hybrid work environment and be able to scale,” Laliberte said.Pricing for Anywhere Workspace, which is available now, depends on individual products used."

  "img_url": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/06/pcw-chrome-primary-100724768-large.jpg",
  "contents": "Google last week released Chrome 90, which gives preference to using encrypted connections to websites, lets users craft links that pinpoint selected text, and supports an open-source codec optimized for videoconferencing.The Mountain View, Calif. search giant also paid out more than  to those who reported some of the 37 vulnerabilities addressed in Chrome 90. Six of the bugs were marked \"High,\" Google's second-most-serious threat level, with $36,000 paid to the reporting security researchers. A number of the bounties, including two labeled \"High,\" had not yet been assigned a dollar amount, so Google's final payout will be higher than the acknowledged total.Because Chrome updates in the background, most users can finish a refresh by relaunching the browser. To manually update, select \"About Google Chrome\" from the Help menu under the three-dot icon at the upper right; the resulting tab shows that the browser has been updated or displays the download process before presenting a Relaunch button. People new to Chrome can  for Windows, macOS, and Linux directly. The Android and iOS browsers can be found in the Google Play and App Store markets, respectively.Google currently updates Chrome about every six weeks; the previous upgrade was released March 2. However, Google has said it will accelerate the Chrome release schedule so that by late September or early October, the interval will have . , in March 2020.Starting with Chrome 90, the browser navigates to a target website using  first when the user doesn't specify the protocol. Only if necessary — when there isn't an encrypted connection to the site — does Chrome fall back to the old preference, .For instance, if the user enters  in Chrome's address bar, the browser assumes the full address is , and reaches the site through the encrypted connection, assuming one is available. (In this example it is.)Besides the obvious benefit to the user's browsing security, the change in Chrome's default, Google claimed, also results in faster initial loading speeds of destination sites. \"Chrome will connect directly to the HTTPS endpoint without needing to be redirected from  to ,\" wrote Shweta Panditrao and Mustafa Emre Acer, two members of the Chrome team, in a  to the Chromium blog.Chrome desktop and Chrome on Android received the new HTTPS default in Chrome 90, but iOS users of the browser did not. That update for iOS Chrome will follow \"soon after\" version 90's debut, said the two Chrome developers.Chrome 90 also boasts a new feature that produces a link that focuses the recipient's attention on a snippet of text or a specific section of the linked page.Called \"link to highlight\" by Google, the feature replicates the function of a Google-made add-on — \"\" — that traced its ancestry back to work done more than a year ago on Chrome 80. When link to highlight is enabled, users who select text on a page, right-click that selection, and choose  from the pop-up menu can paste the resulting link in an email address, text message, or document.When the recipient clicks that link, she is taken not simply to the intended URL, but to the previously highlighted location on that page, with the highlighted text, well, actually highlighted in yellow.According to Google, link to highlight \"is rolling out now to desktop and Android and is coming soon for iOS.\"Chrome users too impatient to wait for Google to switch on the feature can do that themselves by entering  in the address bar, pressing  or , then searching for \"copy link to text.\" Change the mode at the right to  and relaunch the browser.The latest Chrome supports the AV1 codec, an open-source format promoted by an industry consortium that includes the biggest names in technology, from Facebook to Google, Apple to Microsoft. Designed as a royalty-free alternative to commercial codecs, AV1 has been optimized for videoconferencing. It also integrates with the WebRTC standard.The encoder shipped in Chrome 90 for desktops and boasts improvements in compression efficiency — which reduces bandwidth consumption and should boost image quality — as well as in screen sharing.  that AV1 made it possible for users with very low bandwidth connections — as low as old-school dial-up speeds — to participate in videoconferencing.Other additions to Chrome 90 that Google touted include thumbnail views of the document's pages when reading a PDF in the browser, a way to label Chrome's windows (not its tabs, but its windows) for easier identification when moving tabs between windows, and notification muting when the browser is screen shared (as when presenting to a group).On the enterprise side, where Chrome competes with Microsoft's Edge, version 90 lets IT administrators configure the now-baked-in Legacy Browser Support — a feature that allowed some sites to be rendered by the obsolete Internet Explorer — so that it opens Edge instead for those designated URLs. Edge then relies on its own IE Mode to render the site or even web app. (More information about this can be found .)Google will ship Chrome's next upgrade, Chrome 91, on May 25. (The first Chrome issued on a four-week interval will be version 95, slated to ship Oct. 19.)"

(The browser also applies a pair of rules that will prevent most site breakage by legitimate application of window.name data sharing.)With this new pro-privacy technique, Mozilla follows Apple, whose Safari already clears . Chromium (and thus Google's Chrome and Microsoft's Edge) has not yet implemented something similar, although the open-source project is working on a solution.Other than Mozilla's  clampdown, Firefox 88 can boast of only a handful of changes, all of them minor.

  "img_url": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/04/google-meet-ui-100885519-large.jpg",
  "contents": "Google has announced a refresh of its Meet user interface for desktop and laptop users, to begin rolling out next month.The updates to the videoconferencing app’s web interface include improvements to video feeds, how you view and present meetings, and the navigation bar. Dave Citron, director of product management for Google Meet, said these improvements aim to “deepen the meeting experience, regardless of how and where people participate.”In a , Citron said that by giving users more control over how they view themselves in meetings, Google hopes to reduce “meeting fatigue.” Users can choose to have their video feed in a standard tile in the grid or as a floating picture, which can be resized, repositioned, or minimized completely. Google said it will also be adding a setting that enables meeting participants to turn off self-feed across all Google Meet calls.While available for free to individuals, Meet is part of the Google Workspace office suite. Subscribers will get additional tools in the refresh, including an autozoom function, which zooms in and positions the user squarely in front.Angela Ashenden, principal analyst for workplace transformation at CCS Insight, said that this refresh represents an important feature update for Google, as it addresses some of the inflexibility in the Meet experience, which saw it falling behind some of its competitors.“The ability to pin more than one video feed where there are multiple speakers, as well as clear highlighting of the active speaker and the removal of the pop-up controls which overlaid the bottom row of video feeds or the shared content, for example, all help to make the meeting experience more user-friendly and less intrusive,” she said.With research from CCS Insight showing that the average person spends 1.7 hours a day on video calls, features that help to reduce the fatigue felt by employees is a must for vendors that want to remain competitive. Ashenden said that allowing Google Meet users both to unpin shared content to create more room for viewing video panels and to remove self-view from the screen help to reduce some of the friction associated with video calls.Additional UI changes include automated live captions in five languages, engagement controls for educators and students, and new mobile capabilities designed to keep team members connected no matter where they are. Google said many of the new enhancements to Meet were “largely inspired” by customer and user feedback.The bottom navigation bar is also getting a refresh. Dial-in codes, attachments, call lists, chat, and other functions will be consolidated along the bottom, creating more screen space for additional participants.Last year, Google introduced low-light mode for Meet on mobile. The feature uses AI to automatically adjust a participant’s video to make them more visible in a dark environment or reduce glare if users have too much light coming in through a sunny window. This light adjustment feature will be coming to the web interface in the coming weeks. Users will also have access to “fun” video backgrounds: a classroom, a party, and a forest, with more coming soon.Ashenden said that these new features show that Google is responding positively to customers’ feedback and is thinking creatively about how to improve the Meet experience. However, she believes there are still areas where it needs improvements. “For example, in how you ensure that the presenter can present content while still being active in the meeting experience, and also the friction and overlap between its chat and Q&A capability,” she said.“These are not necessarily areas where its competition has solved the problem, as these are common challenges with meeting tools,” she noted. “[But] if it’s going to catch up with the likes of Zoom and Microsoft Teams, it’s important for Google to be innovating and raising the bar in a much more definitive way.”"

  "contents": "Microsoft has made a couple of important announcements for Mac and iOS-using enterprises, including moves toward a new “perpetual” version of Office and improvements to its popular Teams collaboration app. Anything Microsoft does with its productivity suite has a consequence for enterprise professionals, even those using Macs, iPads, and iPhones. After all, 650,000 US companies have standardized around Office, and Microsoft has more than 258 million monthly Office 365/Microsoft 365 users, including plenty who use the suite on Apple’s products. Boosted by COVID-19 and the shift to remote work, the company in October told us that its collaboration tool, Microsoft Teams, now sees .Not every consumer or enterprise wants, needs, or can make use of the company’s subscription-based Microsoft 365, but the company wants to retain those customers, so it typically offers what it calls a “perpetual” version of the suite that doesn’t require a subscription and doesn’t receive feature updates.With this in mind, Microsoft in February  it would introduce a “pay once, use for five years” version of Office to . Both  and Windows versions of Office 2021 will be made.Microsoft also confirmed a business-focused product,  which is basically the same thing, but aimed at enterprises who keep systems offline.“The next perpetual version of Office for commercial customers is built specifically for organizations running regulated devices that cannot accept feature updates for years at a time, process control devices that are not connected to the internet in manufacturing facilities, and specialty systems that must stay locked in time and require a long-term servicing channel,” the company  when it announced its plans.Both Office LTSC and Office 2021 for Mac have now been made available to enterprises in Microsoft’s official preview channel, which suggests that the products should be made available in the coming weeks. Office 2021 Standard for Mac (Preview) includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, OneDrive, and Teams. The preview will be updated approximately once a month during the preview period and works natively on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs. Enterprises can trial Office 2021 for Mac .The company hasn’t yet told us when it intends to launch Office 2021 for Mac.Microsoft has also updated Teams for iOS (with some Android improvements). For iOS users, the most important change is the introduction of new ways to manage conversation streams. iPhone and iPad users will be able to view, pin, and manage pinned chats.The update also introduces new emojis and catches up with Zoom by adding the ability to change the background in calls and meetings. Another new feature lets iPhone and iPad users invite distribution lists and groups when scheduling a meeting.One recent Microsoft move may not at first seem Apple-focused. The latest  lets Windows users run Linux applications natively thanks to the first preview of GUI app support on the Windows Subsystem for Linux.Now, this isn’t especially interesting to Mac users, except, of course, when you consider the continued speculation concerning Microsoft’s plans around .The reason I think the prognosis seems positive is because Microsoft’s Linux GUI support represents the extent to which the company’s PC strategy has changed. It doesn’t want to be the OS for every computer but does want to provide software, services and infrastructure within every ecosystem. Within this context, it makes sense for it to make Windows for ARM available to Mac users . It might also make sense to Windows users, given that M1 Macs run the OS .Of course, Microsoft may have other plans to make its OS available as a , but its Office plans show it recognizes that not every user wants to be exposed online. Indeed, a recent Microsoft article  stresses the need for flexibility.Apple is rapidly increasing its share of the enterprise market. Its recently announced spring products will , so it makes sense to anticipate that Microsoft will want to come along for the ride. One year since we learned Apple planned to migrate Macs to Apple Silicon, might the official introduction of Windows on ARM be one of the highlights for announcement at ?"

  "contents": "Microsoft last week released to corporate customers a preview of the next pay-once, perpetual license version of its Office suite.The application bundle — by far  productivity standard in business — came with a mouth-twisting name change: . As it did in February when it revealed some information about the successor to Office 2019, Microsoft again argued that the new suite is a limited-use option for enterprises.\"The next perpetual version of Office for commercial customers is built specifically for organizations running regulated devices that cannot accept feature updates for years at a time, process control devices that are not connected to the Internet in manufacturing facilities, and specialty systems that must stay locked in time and require a long-term servicing channel,\" the Microsoft 365 team wrote in an .Microsoft saddled the corporate perpetual license with , for , to tie Office to Windows 10 LTSC, which has long been begrudged by Microsoft as perhaps a necessary option, but one it's not keen to offer.Essentially, Microsoft is only making plainer its preference for subscription-based Office — sold in Office 365 and Microsoft 365 plans — over an all-on-premises productivity ecosystem, of which Office LTSC will be a cornerstone (and which Office 2019 serves as now).On Windows, the preview can be installed only via enterprise tools, including the Office Deployment Tool (ODT), available as a , and the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager. The preview of Office LTSC Professional Plus 2021 must, like production-grade editions, be activated; Microsoft has provided instructions for using ODT and Configuration Manager, as well as the necessary keys, in .The Mac preview can be installed using the standard installer package file (in PKG format), although a second file must be downloaded to activate the preview.Both the Windows and Mac previews will work normally until Jan. 17, 2022. After that date, the suites will go into \"reduced functionality mode\" which will allow users to only read and print documents. It will not be possible to create new documents or edit existing ones with the reduced applications.As with previous versions of Office, the next single-payment suite will include a subset of the features and functionality available to users running the same applications under an Office or Microsoft 365 subscription. Only a handful of the perks added to those plans' applications will be promoted to Office LTSC and/or Office 2021 for Mac, the nameplate of the macOS edition. Microsoft has highlighted only a few of those new features, which included a line-by-line focus in Word and the new XLOOKUP function in Excel.Office LTSC's feature set is, well, set in stone when it releases. Unlike the apps provided by an Office or Microsoft 365 subscription, Office LTSC (or Office 2021 for Mac) are updated with security and other bug fixes only. \"Keep in mind that after Office LTSC is released, Office LTSC won’t receive any new features,\" Microsoft warned.Microsoft has not yet set a date for the launch of Office LTSC/Office 2021 for Mac; it has only narrowed the target to \"later this year.\"The Redmond, Wash. developer will also issue a one-time-purchase, perpetual license version of Office for consumers and small businesses. The suite, available for both Windows and macOS, will be named . Like Office LTCS, this version will be released later this year. However, it will not be previewed, Microsoft said."

  "contents": "I've been thinking an awful lot about Pixel phones lately. And it seems safe to say the cause for my current contemplation is a teensy bit unusual.The burning question in Android Land at this particular moment, y'see, is why Google  preparing to launch a new Pixel phone that seems shockingly similar to one of its -generation Pixel models — which itself existed in a strange in-between position, with no obvious reason for its presence in last year's . (Oof. My head hurts.)That, however, is not the question we're here to consider today. Until Google actually releases that device, we don't necessarily know the full picture of what it entails, and all we can do is speculate.Today, the puzzler I want to ponder is a bigger-picture question about the Pixel line's existence and how Google is — or maybe — positioning the phone for success.As part of my just-launched , I've been leading folks on a deep-dive journey to explore some of the most useful — and, in many cases, unique — possibilities presented by Google's Pixel phones. And while chatting with some of the smart and attractive land-mammals who've signed up to uncover the hidden secrets of their pocket-sized Pixel pals, I've been reminded of something: Google really does a mind-bogglingly bad job of publicizing the Pixel's strengths.Now, I'm not talking about the higher-level Pixel advantages, like the phone's exceptional user experience or its  of post-sales software support. Those are critically important qualities, without a doubt, but they aren't exactly perks that are easy to articulate to the phone-buying masses. They're fairly abstract, somewhat technical, and just not the sorts of things you can placard on a billboard and use to grab the attention of an average tech-seeking Homo sapien (and/or platypus).But you know what types of perks  easy to market? Yep, you guessed it: the ones that involve specific features designed to address common pain points and make your life a little easier. (Man, you're good!) And that's especially true when those perks revolve around futuristic-sounding Google smarts — smarts no other company can even come close to matching.are the features that set the Pixel apart in meaningful, practical, and impossibly enticing ways — and yet, Google does practically nothing to promote those sorts of possibilities. Not only is the general phone-buying public woefully unaware of their existence, but Pixel owners themselves, as my Academy interactions have reminded me, are positively blown away when they learn what their devices have been able to do all this time.We can find numerous examples that fit into this narrative, but two Assistant-connected systems stand out the most. The first is a feature that automatically screens calls from private, unknown, or suspected spam numbers and can also answer and screen incoming call on demand. Google's silky-voiced virtual helper actually picks up the phone and asks the caller what they're calling about, then relays that info to you on your screen. You can even ask follow-up questions to get extra info, if you want, before deciding if you want to deal with the call yourself or let Assistant take a message.I mean, really: Who  want access to that?!The second feature is a vaguely related system that relies on Assistant to hold  you anytime you find yourself in the unenviable position of hearing how \"important your call is\" (and how it'll be answered, of course, in the order it was received — insert retching sound here). Whenever such a situation arises, a Pixel phone puts a prompt on the screen offering to take over the holding for you and then alert you as soon as an alleged human comes back on the line.Pretty forkin' incredible, right? You'd better believe it. And both features work impressively well, too.Now riddle me this: How often have you seen those features advertised or promoted, whether within an actual Pixel phone or in some form of external marketing? Unless you've been living in a dramatically different world from the one I've been wading around lately, the answer probably falls somewhere between \"extremely rarely\" and \"never.\"I mean, heck, even on  where Google explicitly tries to convince people to buy Pixel phones, the company makes absolutely no mention of either of these awe-inspiring elements. Instead, its top selling point is the fact that Pixel phones \"come preloaded with all the Google apps you love.\"Erm, right.  what makes these phones special?  what's gonna convince regular phone-buyin' folk to leave behind the brilliantly marketed brands they've known and trusted for ages — devices where, mind you, said Google apps are  readily available? Really, Google?!Now imagine if the next iPhone came with these exact same features — the A.I.-enabled call screener and hold-for-you technology. Imagine how Apple would market those possibilities. They'd be innovative, groundbreaking, , damn it! They'd be life-transforming systems available \"only on iPhone\" (because when someone pretentiously avoids the use of articles while referring to their products, you  they have to be important).Plain and simple, we'd never hear the end of it. And with Google? Google's got the goods this very minute. And we never hear a single peep about it.It's not just these newer Assistant-connected bits of intelligence that fit into this pattern, either. From more or less the get-go, Pixel phones have had a clever system for working hand-in-hand with Google Photos and automatically clearing out local copies of backed-up media whenever a phone's storage starts to run low. It's a simple thing, but it's such a nice little addition and another perfect example of a high-impact, hassle-eliminating feature. We've all had the frustration of running low on local storage, after all. And even if you use Photos for backing up your images, the onus still falls upon you to periodically go in and clean up the local copies —  you own a Pixel, in which case, Google services can work together in harmony and handle it all for you without any ongoing effort.That's the very first item in day 5 of my Pixel Academy e-course. And guess what? It's one of the things I've heard the most reactions about — reactions from people who  Pixels and had no idea it was present or possible.And all of that's to say nothing about the equally underplayed notion of Pixels and privacy — an almost ironic-seeming advantage, considering the endless questions surrounding  these days, but an area where Google could seriously set its phones apart from the ,  setups its Android-embracing partners provide without most folks even realizing it.Marketing has never been Google's strength, to put it mildly. But as we gear up for the Pixel line's sixth generation of devices — a generation that's expected to be a real turning point for the products, with the first-ever Google-made processor and all  — it's hard not to wonder how the company continues to miss the mark so badly on emphasizing the Pixel's most outwardly impressive advantages. And it's hard not to wonder how different the sales picture could be if it ever figured out how to present its products in a way that actually resonated on a large scale.Google's got the goods. Now it's gotta figure out how to let people know about 'em instead of hiding 'em away as Android's best-kept and most mystifying secret."

  "contents": "Enterprises should install Apple’s latest macOS Big Sur 11.3 update to secure their Macs. I spoke with Jamf Mac security expert Jaron Bradley, who explained why.Enterprise users running fleets of Macs should get their IT support teams to approve the installation of Apple’s macOS Big Sur 11.3 update as swiftly as possible; the update should protect Macs against a serious software vulnerability that places data at risk.As first spotted by  (and subsequently heavily researched by Jamf), the malware — a new version of a known Shlayer vulnerability — spreads in the following ways:When exploited, the vulnerability allows unapproved software to run on Macs and can enable attackers to access personal data. What makes this threat more serious is that none of the Mac’s defensive tools, including Gatekeeper, Notarization, or File Quarantine can prevent it, unless they're updated to macOS 11.3.Enterprises users should be aware that the security team at Jamf found hackers have been exploiting the vulnerability since Jan. 9. Jamf has published an in-depth explanation of the malware and . Owens has an explanation as to how he was able to weaponize the flaw, which .Within five days of being told about the problem, Apple moved to rectify it with . With this update, users attempting to install the malware will be told it “cannot be opened because the developer cannot be identified.\" They will also be urged to delete the installer.The fact the malware can push past existing Mac security should be seen as a warning to enterprise users to keep their Macs updated.I spoke with Jaron Bradley, manager for macOS detections at Jamf, to find out more concerning this latest threat. Bradley's not-surprising advice for enterprises: install macOS 11.3 “as soon as possible.”\"The most interesting thing about this malware is that the author has taken an old version of it [Shlayer] and modified it slightly to abuse a bug [that] allowed it to bypass security features on macOS,\" Bradley said.\"The earliest Shlayer sample that we've discovered using this technique was reported on January 9th, 2021. The number of users impacted by this specific variant is not currently known, but a  stated that in 2019 1 in 10 users was infected by Shalyer. Those numbers are old at this point, but Shlayer continues to be one of the most active and prevalent malware families for macOS.\"\"Unknown users may stumble upon it by visiting legitimate websites that have been hijacked, which may ultimately redirect them to a new site hosting the malware. It is also commonly spread on pirating sites posing as free cracked software or sites that play pirated videos. Users are often prompted by the website to install it to watch the expected video.\"\"For companies looking to protect their employees, we at Jamf would encourage running third-party security software capable of detecting these types of attacks. For technical users who want to know if the vulnerability that Shlayer abuses has been used on their Mac, Patrick Wardle at  released a free tool that can perform such a check.\"\"Apple makes many updates to their complex security features on a regular basis. At some point, one of these complex updates created an unintentional bug that allowed attackers to bypass many security features on the operating system.\"\"The vulnerabilities that this malware abuses can be mitigated by upgrading to macOS 11.3. Apple has also updated their built-in anti-virus engine that now catches additional variants of Shalyer malware when identified.\"\"Jamf recommends a patch-fast-and-patch-often type of policy. When updates that fix large bugs come out, it’s best to install them as soon as possible.\""

  "contents": "Microsoft has patented an employee “wellbeing” recommendation feature that uses biometric data to detect a worker’s stress levels when completing tasks such as sending emails, encouraging them to take a break when anxiety levels run high.The , filed in October 2019 and published last week, describes a “wellness insights service” that collates data from a range of sources. This includes blood pressure and heartrate monitoring data that could be obtained from an employees’ wearable devices, such as smart watches and fitness trackers.The biometric data sources are combined with data generated within Microsoft’s Office apps to create an employee “anxiety score.” The range of possible inputs highlighted in the patent include audio and video meeting data, haptic sensor feedback showing how hard keys are pressed on a keyboard, or simply the amount of time it takes to draft an email.Once the anxiety score threshold is met, an algorithm would then alert the employee and suggest an action. Those alerts might include telling a worker they're making more corrections than usual when drafting an email, or that their voice sounded agitated during a call; the feature would then recommend taking a break or perhaps a short walk to calm down.The patent application was initially highlighted by the  and comes as employee wellbeing has become a  — particularly during the pandemic, where the use of cloud apps boomed even as many workers reported burnout.It was not immediately clear whether Microsoft plans to release products based on the patent application. Companies routinely seek patents for technology or other intellectual property that don't necessarily translate into real-world offerings.Microsoft recently took steps to combat worker stress with the introduction of a new capability in Outlook calendars that allows business customers to set all meetings to finish early or start late to prevent back-to-back meetings piling up. That's come to be seen as a common cause of stress for remote workers and has prompted companies to seek innovate ways to engage employees and .Microsoft has introduced a several workplace analytics tools to its productivity and collaboration application suite in recent years. This includes MyAnalytics, which surfaces data to individual workers about their working habits and provides a range of wellbeing recommendations, encouraging them to reduce the number of meetings, for instance, or highlighting a potential lack of “focus” time.The company also , part of a new Teams-based employee-experience platform; it incorporates MyAnalytics and Workplace Analytics – another analytics tool Microsoft 365 that offers higher-level insights aimed at managers and business leaders.  Other software vendors are ; Cisco and Google are among the companies moving to offer wellbeing analytics to individual employees based on their application use.The introduction of analytics into such tools has raised concerns about the potential for workplace surveillance, and vendors have been keen to highlight the employee wellbeing benefits, as well as ensuring that personal analytics are only available to the individual worker.Biometric data is less common for tracking worker wellbeing and use of the technology in a workplace setting has at times proved controversial; Amazon has reportedly required delivery drivers to sign “biometric consent” forms and agree to storage of facial recognition biometric data.When Cisco unveiled its plans to offer \"People Insights\" earlier this month, company officials stressed that personal analytics are anonymized and not accessible by managers. “They're not meant for your organization, they're not meant for your boss, they're not meant for your peers, it's only for you,” said Jeetu Patel, senior vice president and general manager for Security and Collaboration at Cisco. “The goal is not to inspect [what workers are doing], the goal is to help you manage your well-being, your productivity and nurture your relationships.”While workplace analytics for both individuals and managers are becoming more widely available, the use of biometric data to monitor employee wellbeing is less common, though the technology is used for authentication purposes in some cases. Its use in some cases can raise concerns about employee privacy, and Raul Castanon, a senior research analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence’s 451 Research advises caution when deploying the technologies.“Consumers are increasingly familiar and comfortable with the use of wearable devices for collecting biometric data to monitor their health and wellbeing; however, extending these capabilities into the workplace will likely be a cause for concern for employees,” said Castanon.“There are many benefits that analytics can provide to employees, including monitoring their health and wellbeing at work and in their personal life, but navigating this area can be extremely delicate for the enterprise.”"

  "contents": "Atlassian has , Jira Work Management, bringing Jira capabilities to all enterprise business teams and enabling departments like marketing, HR, finance, and design to easily connect their work with that of their technical counterparts.Over the past year, organizations have had to compress multi-year digital transformation plans into weeks and months, with many scrambling to find the right tools to support their workers and allow collaborative work to continue.Cameron Deatsch, chief revenue officer at Atlassian, said that although the company had seen a lot of organizations use platforms like Jira to track work while offices were closed, the company understands that sitting next to colleagues in the office offers benefits not easily replicated at home.“There’s a whole bunch of stuff that’s easy to track when you’re ... with your team, but as you go virtual, you can’t just jump on a video call every time you want to have a conversation about a small task,” he said. “Obviously, you can do some of it over email, or Slack, or PowerPoint, or spreadsheets, but you aren’t able to keep track of things and it’s very easy to lose your work.”Deatsch noticed that a growing number of companies with technical teams already using Jira were co-opting the platform for non-technical uses, squeezing and modifying it to deal with problems Jira wasn’t built to solve.Charlez Betz, principal analyst serving infrastructure and operations professionals at Forrester Research, said the last 12 months has seen a shift in the project management arena.“We see a clear move “from project to product” – long term, steady-state teams that continually handle a flow of ongoing improvement,” he said. “Jira at its core has long handled this reasonably well and Jira Work Management brings a similar capability forward for non-technical teams.”For Deatsch, Jira Work Management represents a big step for Atlassian; taking the platform outside of what is considered its historical core of solving largely technical issues and turning it into something that supports broader work management processes.While taking Jira out of the software development space might have initially raised eyebrows, the bigger risk for Atlassian was doing nothing, Betz said.Jira Work Management offers three core functionalities to help organizations achieve work continuity. These include an intuitive and easy to use platform, new view, and a connection to technical teams already using the traditional Jira platform.The new views include:The intuitive design takes into account that not every company looking to roll out Jira Work Management will have a “Jira Wizard” on site to walk new users through the platform. “We have a unique charter for work management, which is that new teams who jump onto [a platform] for the first time should be able to actually track and manage their work without any kind of training whatsoever,” said Chase Wilson, head of product marketing for Jira Work Management.New users will have access to more than 20 new business project templates and get unlimited, free automation within projects. Users can select pre-made rules from the business automation library or create custom rules for any use case and department. Automation also connects with Slack, Microsoft Teams, and email providers to extend the power of Jira to other tools.Additionally, while Jira Work Management takes into account that business teams work differently than their technical counterparts, the shared architecture between it, Jira Software, and Jira Service Management allows cross-department collaboration to happen seamlessly — even when the teams involved use different versions of the Jira platform.Betz said that, in general, Jira Work Management is consistent with the overall trend towards Enterprise Service Management.“Jira as a framework is a powerful, stable, well known platform. It has not been quite as feature rich as major players such as ServiceNow and Cherwell (now Ivanti), but recent Atlassian acquisitions in the data management and UI spaces are closing the gap,” he said."

  "img_url": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/04/android-security-scare-100886445-large.jpg",
  "contents": "Holy floppin' hellfire, Henry! Have you heard? A terrifying new form of Android malware is running amok — stealing passwords, emptying bank accounts, and drinking all the grape soda from the refrigerators of unsuspecting Android phone owners.We should all be quivering in our rainboots, according to almost all the information I've read on these here internets. Numerous adjective-filled news stories have warned me that the \"scary new Android malware\" is \"spreading quickly,\" targeting \"millions\" () of users, and occasionally even \"kicking people square in the groin.\" (All right, so I made that last part up. But you get the idea.)BUT WAIT! It gets worse: The malware,  (because it wouldn't be Android malware if it didn't have an annoyingly cutesy name), works by showing up on your phone, gaining access to all of your most sensitive data, and then sending your deepest secrets to hooligans who are preemptively cackling over your unavoidable misfortune.It's enough to make you want to toss your Android phone into the nearest quarry and go into permanent hiding. I get it — who react that way? Before you start searching for the nearest bunker, though, there's something you should know about this menacing Android malware. And it's something that, if we're being fully honest, applies to the vast majority of fear-inducing Android security stories we see out in the wild.Ready? This Android malware  be incredibly scary for you — , that is, you're a complete and total nitwit.No offense to the complete and total nitwits of the world (we love you, we really do), but let me provide a little oft-missing context about how exactly this latest  actually works:In related news, if a suspicious-looking fella approaches you on the street and asks for your wallet — then tells you three different times what he'll be able to do if you give him your wallet and confirms four times that you actually want to give it to him, anyway — well, by golly, if you go ahead and hand him that wallet, some bad stuff is probably gonna happen.All analogies aside, there's actually one more asterisk to this, and it's an important one: In an enterprise arrangement, any company whose IT department isn't made up entirely of complete and total nitwits would have policies preventing users from installing apps from random unknown sources in the first place. Such policies are in place by default on a managed Android enterprise arrangement, in fact, so the IT folk would've had to deliberately  that form of protection in order for any of these hijinks to be possible on a company-connected phone.Android enterprise policies can also control exactly which apps are allowed to be set as accessibility services, so there's another layer of nitwit protection. And that's to say nothing of the anti-phishing measures lots of companies  on their devices. In virtually any (non-nitwit-involving) business situation, then, you'd never get past step 3 — or possibly even step 2 — no matter how hard you tried.And even in an individual user situation, you'd  have to work pretty darn diligently to let an app like this do its dirty bidding, given all the barriers Android puts up before you could reach the point of actual danger.And y'know what? It's more or less the  . That's absolutely the case with another Android bogeyman making the rounds right now — a \"sophisticated new malicious app\" that \"disguises itself as a System Update application\" and steals \"data, messages, [and] images\" while simultaneously \"taking control of Android phones\" and monitoring everything from your phone call contents to your messages and even your browser history (yes, including that one site you looked at before bed last night).But, oh yeah: You'd have to go to some random unofficial website to find and download the thing and then skate past all those same sorts of prompts to install it and give it the various forms of advanced access it needs to operate. And if you're using a work-connected phone, you probably couldn't do any of that, anyway.Oh, and the company pushing  about that one, by the way? It's Zimperium, which conveniently and coincidentally happens to sell security software for Android devices. (Funny how that , isn't it?)The bottom line is this, my fellow Android-carrying hominid: Android security can certainly seem scary on the surface, especially if you spend much time swimming in the endless stream of sensational stories about it. And goodness gracious, some weeks, those fear-infested waters can be damn-near impossible to avoid.Once you start looking closely and asking , though, an Android security scare is almost always far less frightening than it initially appears. And despite what the companies pushing these narratives would presumably prefer, there's rarely any real reason to panic — so long as even the shred of common (non-complete-and-total-nitwit) sense is involved."

  "contents": "Apple CEO Tim Cook believes many of his company’s enterprise customers will continue to support  once the threat of COVID-19 recedes.Cook's comments came as he was discussing his company’s . “It seems like many companies will be operating in a hybrid kind of mode,” he said about record-setting Mac and iPad sales. “And so, it would seem that work from home and the productivity of working from home will remain very critical.”Apple shared some data that may help illustrate how the pandemic has driven a work (and learn) from home equipment sales jamboree, with record sales in every product category and geography.“About two thirds of people buying Mac or iPad are doing so for the first time” in some regions, he said.Citing cross-industry , he also warned: “Expect to be supply-gated, not demand-gated when it comes to Mac and iPad sales across the rest of the year.”As is customary during earnings calls, Luca Maestri, Apple's CFO, mentioned several major Apple product deployments that emerged during the just gone quarter. “In the enterprise market, customers across many industries are accelerating their adoption of iPhone 12 and 5G as a key platform for the future of their business,” he said. Among them:When it comes to enterprise deployment, Apple will likely continue to benefit from the work-from-home trend. Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster says:“Apple will remain a growth story for the foreseeable future. The company will benefit from a multi-year 5G cycle, an accelerating digital transformation driving demand for its products and services, and eventual new product categories.”“Demand feels very strong right now,” said Cook. ...On the Mac side, you have the combination of the M1 and work from home and remote learning, and on iPad, you've got remote learning and work from home as well.”Cook’s observation that both Macs and iPads benefit from the global adoption of hybrid working models seems particularly appropriate given the recent . With the same processor now inside both Macs and iPads, industry watchers expect Apple to make some big changes to the iPad UI so users can properly exploit that locked in power.Cook’s understanding that both products serve these markets hints at a wider understanding across Apple of the importance of both product families to the needs of enterprise professionals. What we don’t know is whether this will extend to , or lead to support for professional apps such as Final Cut Pro, Xcode or Logic X.Meanwhile the macro-trend remains.  want to continue to work remotely when the pandemic recedes. There is also a great deal of support for hybrid working models.Writing , HSBC CEO Noel Quinn said that once the pandemic ends he wants to be able to reconnect with colleagues in an open plan office environment, but also intends “moving to a hybrid model across HSBC.”General Motors, , and others are  in favor of hybrid working models. This shift is visible across most nations; even the  has announced plans for hybrid work.Apple has quite clearly benefitted from this trend, which means both personal and professional uses of devices are becoming even more closely combined as in most cases both take place on the same device.I expect we’ll get some sense as to how Apple sees this transformation at  when we learn to what extent the next iterations of the company's operating systems reflect this deep societal change.Perhaps the iPad pointer will at least develop a Mac like cursor when used with an external mouse. Perhaps Apple has more profound changes to boost collaboration and communication in mind. We should know more soon."
